  <div class="core-problem">
    <h2 class="fade-in-line">Radiation defines the limits of human survival.</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-line">Ionizing radiation damages DNA, disrupts cellular function, and accumulates invisibly over time. Once exposure occurs, its biological consequences cannot be undone.</p>
    <p class="fade-in-line">In space, radiation limits how far and how long humans can travel. In medicine, it saves lives while permanently damaging healthy tissue. Yet protection remains largely passive and so humans are still expected to endure exposure rather than actively manage its effects.</p>

  <!-- DUAL WORLD SPLIT -->
  <div class="dual-world">
    <div class="world left">
      <h3>Space Exploration</h3>
      <p>Beyond low Earth orbit, radiation is the primary health risk to astronauts. NASA identifies radiation exposure as the leading barrier to long-duration missions, with projected cancer risks exceeding allowable limits for Mars-class exploration. Despite decades of research, effective, adaptive protection remains minimal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="world right">
      <h3>Radiation-Based Medicine</h3>
      <p>Over 17 million radiation therapy treatments are delivered globally each year. While radiation destroys cancer cells, it also damages surrounding healthy tissue — limiting dosage, increasing side effects, and reducing long-term quality of life. Few technologies exist to protect healthy biology during treatment.</p>

      Introducing the Adaptive Radioprotective System (A.R.S)
    </h2>

    <p class="fade-in-line solution-intro">
      A.R.S. is the first ever modular, wearable system designed to actively manage radiation exposure and its biological effects. Rather than treating radiation as unavoidable, A.R.S. responds dynamically, integrating physical shielding, real-time sensing, and biologically informed mitigation to protect human health when exposure cannot be avoided.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CORE PILLARS -->
  <div class="solution-cards">

    <div class="solution-card fade-in-line">
      <h3>Modular Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        A.R.S. is built as a configurable system. Layers can be added, removed, or reconfigured depending on radiation environment, mission duration, or clinical need, optimizing protection without unnecessary mass or interference.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-card fade-in-line">
      <h3>Real-Time Exposure Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Embedded dosimetry continuously tracks radiation exposure and cumulative dose. This real-time awareness replaces assumptions with data, enabling informed protective responses tailored to actual conditions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-card fade-in-line">
      <h3>Biologically Informed Protection</h3>
      <p>
        A.R.S. is designed around how radiation damages the body. By supporting downstream biological recovery processes, the system reduces oxidative stress and DNA damage without altering therapeutic radiation or mission-critical activity.

  <div class="layer" data-layer="1">
    <img src="images/layer-1-outer.png" alt="Outer Structural Layer" />
    <div class="layer-text">
      <h3>Outer Structural Layer</h3>
      <p>The outer structural layer provides mechanical integrity, abrasion resistance, and environmental durability, forming the protective backbone of the system. It is engineered to withstand operational stresses while serving as a stable platform for the integration of all underlying functional layers.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="layer" data-layer="2">
    <img src="images/layer-2-hydrogen.png" alt="Hydrogen-Rich Layer" />
    <div class="layer-text">
      <h3>Hydrogen-Rich (H) Layer</h3>
      <p>This layer uses hydrogen-rich materials to reduce secondary particle formation caused by high-energy radiation interactions. By minimizing biologically damaging secondary radiation, it addresses a critical limitation of conventional shielding, particularly in space environments.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="layer" data-layer="3">
    <img src="images/layer-3-absorber.png" alt="Absorber Layer" />
    <div class="layer-text">
      <h3>Absorber Layer</h3>
      <p>The absorber layer is designed to attenuate penetrating ionizing radiation that bypasses surface-level shielding, including complex particle interactions. Its composition targets energy reduction rather than simple blocking, enhancing protection where traditional materials are least effective.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="layer" data-layer="4">
    <img src="images/layer-4-sensor.png" alt="Sensor Layer" />
    <div class="layer-text">
      <h3>Sensor Layer</h3>
      <p>Embedded dosimetry and sensor fusion systems continuously measure real-time and cumulative radiation exposure across the body. This data-driven layer transforms A.R.S. from passive protection into an adaptive system informed by actual exposure conditions.</p>

    <div class="layer-text">
      <h3>Biological Mitigation Layer</h3>
      <p>The biological mitigation layer supports the body’s natural recovery processes by addressing downstream effects of radiation exposure, including oxidative stress and DNA damage. Rather than interfering with radiation delivery, it is designed to protect healthy tissue after exposure has occurred.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 1 — BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATION -->
  <div class="validation-block fade-in-line">
    <h3>Biological Research Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      Hands-on laboratory research in DNA damage, repair pathways, and genomic
      instability informed how radiation harms healthy tissue and how those
      effects might be reduced. This biological grounding ensures A.R.S. is
      designed around real cellular processes, not theoretical assumptions.

    <h3>System-to-Biology Mapping</h3>
    <p>
      Each functional layer of A.R.S. was mapped to a known radiation interaction
      or biological response pathway. Hydrogen-rich materials reduce secondary
      particle damage. Absorber layers attenuate penetrating radiation. Sensor
      data informs adaptive decisions. Biological mitigation targets downstream
      oxidative stress and DNA damage.
