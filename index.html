    <h2 class="fade-in-line">Radiation defines the limits of human survival.</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-line">Ionizing radiation damages DNA, disrupts cellular function, and accumulates invisibly over time. Once exposure occurs, its biological consequences cannot be undone.</p>
    <p class="fade-in-line">In space, radiation limits how far and how long humans can travel. In medicine, it saves lives while permanently damaging healthy tissue. Yet protection remains largely passive and so humans are still expected to endure exposure rather than actively manage its effects.</p>

      <p>Beyond low Earth orbit, radiation is the primary health risk to astronauts. NASA identifies radiation exposure as the leading barrier to long-duration missions, with projected cancer risks exceeding allowable limits for Mars-class exploration. Despite decades of research, effective, adaptive protection remains minimal.</p>

   <h2>
  Introducing the Adaptive Radioprotective System (A.R.S)
  </h2>

    <p class="fade-in-line solution-intro">
      A.R.S. is the first ever modular, wearable system designed to actively manage radiation exposure and its biological effects. Rather than treating radiation as unavoidable, A.R.S. responds dynamically, integrating physical shielding, real-time sensing, and biologically informed mitigation to protect human health when exposure cannot be avoided.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CORE PILLARS -->
  <div class="solution-cards">

    <div class="solution-card fade-in-line">
      <h3>Modular Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        A.R.S. is built as a configurable system. Layers can be added, removed, or reconfigured depending on radiation environment, mission duration, or clinical need, optimizing protection without unnecessary mass or interference.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-card fade-in-line">
      <h3>Real-Time Exposure Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Embedded dosimetry continuously tracks radiation exposure and cumulative dose. This real-time awareness replaces assumptions with data, enabling informed protective responses tailored to actual conditions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-card fade-in-line">
      <h3>Biologically Informed Protection</h3>
      <p>
        A.R.S. is designed around how radiation damages the body. By supporting downstream biological recovery processes, the system reduces oxidative stress and DNA damage without altering therapeutic radiation or mission-critical activity.

      <h3>Outer Structural Layer</h3>
      <p>The outer structural layer provides mechanical integrity, abrasion resistance, and environmental durability, forming the protective backbone of the system. It is engineered to withstand operational stresses while serving as a stable platform for the integration of all underlying functional layers.</p>

      <h3>Hydrogen-Rich (H) Layer</h3>
      <p>This layer uses hydrogen-rich materials to reduce secondary particle formation caused by high-energy radiation interactions. By minimizing biologically damaging secondary radiation, it addresses a critical limitation of conventional shielding, particularly in space environments.</p>

      <h3>Absorber Layer</h3>
      <p>The absorber layer is designed to attenuate penetrating ionizing radiation that bypasses surface-level shielding, including complex particle interactions. Its composition targets energy reduction rather than simple blocking, enhancing protection where traditional materials are least effective.</p>

  <h3>Biological Research Foundation</h3>
  <p>
    Hands-on laboratory research in DNA damage, repair pathways, and genomic
    instability informed how radiation harms healthy tissue and how those
    effects might be reduced. This biological grounding ensures A.R.S. is

    Each functional layer of A.R.S. was mapped to a known radiation interaction
    or biological response pathway. Hydrogen-rich materials reduce secondary
    particle damage. Absorber layers attenuate penetrating radiation. Sensor
    data informs adaptive decisions. Biological mitigation targets downstream
    oxidative stress and DNA damage.

  <div class="impact-section fade-in">
    <h3>Aerospace Impact</h3>
    <h4>Enabling Missions That Are Currently Too Risky to Fly</h4>

    <p>
      Existing space radiation strategies focus on shielding, dose limits, and statistical risk modeling.
      They do not actively manage how radiation damage accumulates in the human body during exposure.
      A.R.S. addresses this gap by coupling real-time exposure awareness with biologically informed mitigation,
      reducing downstream cellular damage rather than simply recording it.
      This shifts radiation protection from passive risk acceptance to active biological management —
      a capability that does not currently exist in human spaceflight systems.

    <h3>Medical Impact</h3>
    <h4>Protecting Patients Without Compromising Treatment</h4>

    <p>
      In radiation oncology, patient harm is often treated as an unavoidable cost.
      A.R.S. reframes this model by actively reducing radiation-induced biological damage
      in healthy tissue without interfering with therapeutic dose delivery.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lower incidence of acute and chronic side effects</li>

  <div class="impact-section fade-in">
    <h3>Systemic Impact</h3>
    <h4>A Platform for Every High-Radiation Environment</h4>

    <p>
      A.R.S. is a modular, scalable platform designed for any environment

      By managing biological consequence rather than exposure alone,
      A.R.S. enables safer operations today and unlocks new possibilities tomorrow.
