  <!-- SECTION 1: CORE PROBLEM -->
  <div class="core-problem">
    <h2 class="fade-in-line">Radiation defines the limits of human survival.</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-line">Ionizing radiation damages DNA, disrupts cellular function, and accumulates invisibly over time. Once exposure occurs, its biological consequences cannot be undone.</p>
    <p class="fade-in-line">In space, radiation limits how far and how long humans can travel. In medicine, it saves lives while permanently damaging healthy tissue. Yet protection remains largely passive and so humans are still expected to endure exposure rather than actively manage its effects.</p>

      <h3>Space Exploration</h3>
      <p>Beyond low Earth orbit, radiation is the primary health risk to astronauts. NASA identifies radiation exposure as the leading barrier to long-duration missions, with projected cancer risks exceeding allowable limits for Mars-class exploration. Despite decades of research, effective, adaptive protection remains minimal.</p>

      <h3>Radiation-Based Medicine</h3>
      <p>Over 17 million radiation therapy treatments are delivered globally each year. While radiation destroys cancer cells, it also damages surrounding healthy tissue — limiting dosage, increasing side effects, and reducing long-term quality of life. Few technologies exist to protect healthy biology during treatment.</p>
